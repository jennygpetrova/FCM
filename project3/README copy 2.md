This report presents a method to efficiently evaluate the lower-upper ($LU$) factorization of a nonsingular matrix $A \in R^{n \times n}$. This factorization is achieved by changing the basis of the full-rank matrix $A$ to an upper triangular form $U$. Nonsingular transformations $T^{-1}_i$ are applied such that
$T^{-1}_i A \to U $
where $U \in R^{n \times n}$ and nonsingular, and the product of the transformations $T_i$ form the unit lower triangular matrix $L \in R^{n \times n}$. Gaussian transformations and permutation arrays ($P_r$, $P_c$) are applied to achieve the transformation $P_r A P_c = LU$
where the indices of $P_r \in R^{n \times n}$ indicate the row order of A, the indices of $P_c \in R^{n \times n}$ indicate the column order of A, $L \in R^{n \times n}$ is a unit lower triangular matrix, and $U \in R^{n \times n}$ is a nonsingular upper triangular matrix. \\
The factorization routines avoid the usage of high-level matrix libraries; solutions are developed by performing in-place updates to the matrix $A$, minimizing memory usage. \\
The accuracy and efficiency of the implemented LU factorizations are evaluated across various test matrices, included randomly generated matrices and specific structured matrices to highlight numerical stability issues.
